Getting Started

First, let’s make sure that your development environment is ready.

    If you don’t have Node.js installed, install it from here.
    You will also need to have the Expo installed, install it from here.

Then configure your development environment from the .env.example file and install the dependencies from your project’s package.json file by running one of the following commands:

<strong>npm install</strong>

or

<strong>expo install</strong>


Finally, after installing the dependencies, the start script starts your Expo "development server" on port 19000.

npm start

or

expot start

That’s it! rocket
